# ⭐ **AI PM MASTER PLAN (90–120 Days)**

4 Tracks run in parallel, but with weekly focus shifts:

1. **Core PM Excellence** (Strategy, Discovery, Roadmaps, PRDs, GTM)
2. **AI Product Fundamentals** (ML concepts + weekly Andrew Ng-style structure)
3. **AI PM Skills & Artifacts** (AI PRDs, prompt prototypes, AI UX, eval frameworks)
4. **Portfolio Project + Interview Prep**

Below is your detailed plan with **deep-dive learning routes**, **weekly breakdown**, and **portfolio deliverables**.

---

## 📁 **Weekly Plans Structure**

Detailed weekly plans with daily breakdowns are available in the `weekly-plans/` directory:
