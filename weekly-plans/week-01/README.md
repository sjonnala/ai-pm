## 🎓 Key Concepts to Master

### PM Strategy:
- **North Star Framework:** Single metric that best captures core value
- **JTBD:** Understanding the "job" users hire your product to do
- **Problem Framing Canvas:** Structure for defining problems before solutions
- **Outcome Hypothesis:** Testable prediction of user behavior change

### AI Fundamentals:
- **Machine Learning:** Systems that learn from data without explicit programming
- **Training vs. Inference:** Learning phase vs. production use
- **Model:** Mathematical representation learned from data
- **Dataset:** Collection of examples used to train models
- **Supervised Learning:** Learning from labeled examples
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns without labels

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Don't rush the fundamentals** - Deep understanding now saves time later
2. **Connect concepts** - Always link AI capabilities to user problems
3. **Think in outcomes** - Focus on "what changes for users" not "what's technically cool"
4. **Study real products** - Best way to learn is analyzing what exists
5. **Ask "why AI?"** - For each opportunity, justify why AI is the right approach
