# AI Opportunity Research Deep Dive

**Week 1 Reference**

Map the problem space like a senior PM by combining strategic framing, signal mining, and rigorous scoring.

## 🧱 Opportunity Thesis Canvas

| Block | Questions to Answer | Evidence Sources |
|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| **User & Job** | Who is the primary user? What job/outcome matters most? | JTBD interviews, support tickets |
| **Pain & Triggers** | What event makes the pain acute? How is it solved today? | Diary studies, funnel drop-offs |
| **Impact Hypothesis** | What metric or behavior changes when solved? | Historical analytics, surveys |
| **AI Advantage** | Why does AI/ML improve this versus rule-based automation? | Benchmark features, tech trends |
| **Strategic Fit** | How does this ladder to company North Star/OKRs? | Strategy docs, exec interviews |
| **Moat Potential** | Data, distribution, workflow lock-in? | Data inventory, partnerships |

> Build this canvas before ideating solutions so the team aligns on the problem framing.

## 🔎 Signal Mining Rituals

| Ritual | Cadence | How to Run | Output |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| **Listening Tour** | 5 user convos/week | Script of "What is hard today?" and "How do you hack it?" | Quotes + pain themes |
| **Telemetry Deep Dive** | Weekly | Slice funnels by persona, device, region | Heatmap of drop-offs |
| **Competitive Sweep** | Monthly | Tear down top 5 overlapping products | Gap table (what they do vs. what they miss) |
| **Field Shadowing** | Quarterly | Observe customers in their tool stack for 2 hrs | Workflow map with hand-offs |

Capture insights in a living doc grouped by JTBD → Pain → Evidence.

## 📊 Opportunity Scoring Model

Use a **4x4 matrix** to avoid pet-project bias.

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring Prompts (1-5) |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------|
| **User Value** | 30% | How drastically does this improve key workflow KPIs? |
| **Strategic Leverage** | 25% | Does it accelerate North Star metric or beachhead market? |
| **AI Feasibility** | 20% | Do we have/obtain the data + model capability in <3 months? |
| **Differentiation** | 15% | Does AI unlock something competitors cannot easily copy? |
| **Excitement / Narrative** | 10% | Will this story excite leadership & recruiting? |

Calculate weighted score, rank, and annotate assumptions + blockers beside each opportunity.

## 🧠 Opportunity Narrative (1-Pager)

Structure your pitch:

1. **Hook:** 2-sentence customer story with data proof.
2. **Problem & Impact:** SCO (Situation, Complication, Opportunity) framing.
3. **Vision Teaser:** Imagine-if statement that highlights the AI superpower.
4. **Proof of Feasibility:** Data availability, model strategy, guardrails.
5. **Next Steps:** Research gaps, stakeholders, and pilot timeline.

Bring this to stakeholder reviews to secure alignment and resources quickly.
