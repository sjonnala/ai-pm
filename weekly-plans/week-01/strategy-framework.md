## 3. Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) Analysis

### The Functional Job
**When** [situation/context]
**I want to** [motivation/goal]
**So I can** [expected outcome]

**Example:** When I'm editing my travel videos, I want to automatically identify and cut out boring segments, so I can publish engaging content faster.

### The Emotional Job
[What emotional need does this fulfill?]
- Feel _____ (competent, creative, efficient, etc.)
- Avoid feeling _____ (frustrated, overwhelmed, inadequate, etc.)

### The Social Job
[How does this affect how users are perceived?]
- Be seen as _____ (professional, creative, productive, etc.)

### Job Statement (Complete JTBD)
**When** [trigger/context]
**I want to** [functional goal]
**So I can** [functional outcome]
**And feel** [emotional outcome]
**And be seen as** [social outcome]

## 4. North Star Metric

### Selected North Star Metric
**Metric:** [The ONE metric that best captures core value delivery]

**Examples:**
- Notion: Time saved on documentation
- Spotify: Hours of music listened
- Slack: Messages sent by teams
- GitHub Copilot: Accepted code suggestions

### Why This Metric?
[How does this metric reflect value to users?]

### Supporting Metrics
1. **Acquisition:** [How users discover/sign up]
2. **Activation:** [First value experience]
3. **Engagement:** [Ongoing usage]
4. **Retention:** [Coming back]
5. **Revenue:** [Monetization metric]

### Input Metrics (What Drives the North Star?)
- [Input metric 1] → drives → [North Star]
- [Input metric 2] → drives → [North Star]
- [Input metric 3] → drives → [North Star]

## 5. Outcome Hypothesis

### Hypothesis Statement
**If we** [build this solution]
**Then** [target users]
**Will** [measurable behavior change]
**Because** [underlying assumption]

### Example:
**If we** build an AI video editing assistant that auto-cuts boring segments
**Then** travel videographers
**Will** publish 2x more videos per month
**Because** editing time is reduced from 4 hours to 1 hour per video

### Testable Predictions
1. [Prediction 1 with metric]
2. [Prediction 2 with metric]
3. [Prediction 3 with metric]

### Assumptions to Validate
Critical assumptions that must be true:
1. [ ] Users will trust AI editing decisions
2. [ ] [Assumption 2]
3. [ ] [Assumption 3]

### How We'll Measure Success
**Short-term (30 days):**
- [Metric 1: Target]
- [Metric 2: Target]

**Medium-term (90 days):**
- [Metric 1: Target]
- [Metric 2: Target]

**Long-term (6 months):**
- [Metric 1: Target]
- [Metric 2: Target]

## 6. Strategic Rationale

### Why AI?
[Why is AI the right approach vs. traditional software?]

**AI Advantages:**
- [Advantage 1: e.g., "Can learn from millions of video patterns"]
- [Advantage 2: e.g., "Adapts to individual user style"]
- [Advantage 3: e.g., "Handles unstructured data (video)"]

**What Makes This AI-Native:**
[What would be impossible without AI/ML?]

### Why Now?
[Why is this the right time?]

**Technology Enablers:**
- [e.g., "Multimodal models can now process video + audio"]
- [e.g., "Inference costs dropped 10x in 2 years"]
- [Model/platform that makes this possible]

**Market Timing:**
- [Market trend 1]
- [User behavior shift]
- [Competitive gap]

**Data Availability:**
[What data exists that makes this feasible?]

### Why Us? (Optional - for when you build portfolio)
[What unique advantage do we have?]
- Domain expertise
- Data access
- Technical capability
- User insights
