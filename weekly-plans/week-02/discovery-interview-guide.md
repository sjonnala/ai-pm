## 🧠 The Discovery Mindset

### **Continuous Discovery**
Discovery isn't a one-time phase - it's ongoing. Talk to users weekly, not just before building.

### **Assume You're Wrong**
Your initial assumptions are probably wrong. Discovery helps you learn the truth.

### **Seek Understanding, Not Validation**
Don't ask leading questions to confirm your ideas. Genuinely seek to understand users' world.

---

## 📋 Planning Discovery Interviews

### **1. Define Your Learning Goals**

**What do you want to learn?**
- User workflows and pain points?
- Willingness to pay for a solution?
- Current alternatives and their gaps?
- Technical requirements for AI solution?

**Example - AI Writing Assistant:**
- How do content marketers currently create blog posts?
- What's most time-consuming or frustrating?
- What tools do they use today?
- Would they trust AI to help write?
- How much would they pay for 10 hours/month saved?

---

### **2. Recruit the Right Participants**

**Target Profile:**
- **Specific:** "Content marketers at B2B SaaS companies" (not "people who write")
- **Current users:** People experiencing the problem NOW
- **Decision-makers:** People who can buy/adopt the solution

**How Many?**
- **Minimum:** 5-10 interviews to start
- **Ideal:** 15-20 for strong patterns
- **Ongoing:** 2-3 per week continuously

**Where to Find Users:**
- LinkedIn (search + outreach)
- Reddit communities
- Industry Slack groups
- Twitter/X
- Your network
- User research platforms (UserInterviews.com)

---

### **3. Craft Your Interview Guide**

**Structure:**
1. **Intro** (5 min): Build rapport, explain purpose
2. **Background** (10 min): Understand their context
3. **Deep Dive** (30 min): Explore workflows, pain points
4. **Wrap-up** (5 min): Anything we missed?

**Total:** 45-60 minutes

---

## 🎤 Conducting Effective Interviews

### **Opening (5 min)**

**Build Rapport:**
> "Thanks for taking the time! I'm learning about how content marketers create blog posts. There are no right or wrong answers - I'm just trying to understand your experience."

**Set Expectations:**
> "I'll ask about your workflow and challenges. I'm not selling anything, just learning. Feel free to be brutally honest!"

---

### **Background Questions (10 min)**

**Understand Context:**
- "Tell me about your role. What does a typical week look like?"
- "How much time do you spend creating content?"
- "What types of content do you create most often?"

**Goal:** Build context for their answers later.

---

### **Discovery Questions (30 min)**

**The Mom Test Principles:**
1. **Talk about their life, not your idea**
2. **Ask about specifics in the past, not generics or the future**
3. **Talk less, listen more**

---

### **Great Discovery Questions:**

**1. Story-Based Questions**
> "Tell me about the last time you created a blog post. Walk me through it step-by-step."

**Why:** Gets specific details, not hypotheticals

---

**2. Pain Point Questions**
> "What's the most frustrating part of creating content?"
> "When was the last time you felt stuck or overwhelmed while writing?"

**Why:** Reveals emotional intensity

---

**3. Workflow Questions**
> "How do you currently [do specific task]?"
> "What tools do you use for this?"

**Why:** Understand current state and alternatives

---

**4. Time/Effort Questions**
> "How long does it typically take to write a 1,500-word blog post?"
> "What takes the most time?"

**Why:** Quantify the problem

---

**5. Value Questions**
> "If you could save 5 hours per week on content creation, what would that be worth to you?"
> "Have you ever paid for tools to help with writing? What do you currently spend?"

**Why:** Understand willingness to pay

---

**6. Trust/Control Questions (AI-Specific)**
> "Have you used AI writing tools? What was that experience like?"
> "Would you feel comfortable publishing AI-generated content? Why or why not?"
> "How much control would you want over what the AI creates?"

**Why:** Critical for AI products - understand trust and control needs

---

### **What NOT to Ask:**

❌ **Leading Questions:**
- "Don't you think writing is time-consuming?" (suggests answer)
- "Wouldn't AI be helpful?" (leading)

✅ **Instead:**
- "How do you feel about the time you spend writing?"
- "Have you tried any tools to speed up writing? What happened?"

---

❌ **Hypothetical Questions:**
- "Would you use an AI writing assistant?"
- "How much would you pay for this?"

✅ **Instead:**
- "What tools have you tried for writing?"
- "What have you paid for writing tools in the past?"

---

❌ **Pitching Your Idea:**
- "I'm building an AI tool that writes blog posts. Would you use it?"

✅ **Instead:**
- "Tell me about your content creation process" (learn first, validate later)

---

### **Active Listening Techniques:**

**1. The Power of Silence**
- Ask a question, then SHUT UP
- Count to 5 in your head
- Let them think and expand

**2. Follow-up Probes**
- "Tell me more about that..."
- "Why is that important?"
- "What happened next?"
- "Can you give me a specific example?"

**3. Reflect Back**
- "So it sounds like the biggest pain point is X. Is that right?"
- Shows you're listening, confirms understanding

**4. Take Notes**
- Write down specific quotes
- Note body language and emotion
- Review notes immediately after

---

## 📊 Analyzing Interview Data

### **1. Synthesize Immediately**
After each interview, spend 15 minutes writing:
- Key insights
- Surprising findings
- Quotes that stood out
- Patterns emerging

---

### **2. Look for Patterns**

After 5-10 interviews, look for:

**Common Pain Points:**
- What did 80%+ mention?
- What made them emotional?

**Consistent Workflows:**
- How do most people do this task?
- What tools are standard?

**Willingness to Pay Signals:**
- Do they currently pay for solutions?
- How much? For what?

---

### **3. Create Personas**

**Based on patterns, create 2-3 personas:**

**Example - Content Marketer Persona:**

**Name:** Sarah, Senior Content Marketer

**Role:**
- B2B SaaS company (50-200 employees)
- Responsible for 8-12 blog posts/month
- Team of 1-2 writers

**Pain Points:**
- Writer's block when starting new posts
- Time pressure (too much to create, not enough time)
- Balancing quality with quantity
- SEO optimization is complex and time-consuming

**Current Tools:**
- Google Docs for writing
- Grammarly for editing
- Ahrefs for SEO
- ChatGPT (experimenting, mixed results)

**Jobs To Be Done:**
- Create high-quality blog posts that drive traffic and leads
- Maintain consistent publishing schedule
- Demonstrate content ROI to management

**Willingness to Pay:**
- Currently spends: $500/month on tools (Grammarly, Ahrefs, etc.)
- Would pay: $50-100/month for tool that saves 10+ hours

---

### **4. Map Opportunity Solution Tree**

From interviews, create OST:
1. **Opportunities** = Pain points discovered
2. **Solutions** = Potential approaches
3. **Experiments** = How to validate

---

## ✅ Validating AI Opportunities

### **Validation Questions for AI Products:**

**1. Technical Feasibility**
- "What data would we need?" (do users have it?)
- "Can current AI do this?" (research state-of-the-art)

**2. User Trust**
- "Would users trust AI for this task?"
- "How much human oversight needed?"

**3. Differentiation**
- "What exists today?"
- "Why would users switch to us?"

**4. Business Model**
- "How much value delivered?" (time saved, revenue increased)
- "What's a reasonable price based on value?"

---

### **Example Validation:**

**Opportunity:** AI-powered content brief generator (automated research + outline)

**Validation:**
✅ **Feasibility:** LLMs can research and summarize → Feasible
✅ **Trust:** Users comfortable with AI brief, they still write → High trust
✅ **Differentiation:** ChatGPT generic, we'd specialize for SEO content → Differentiated
✅ **Business:** Saves 2 hours per post × 8 posts/month = 16 hours × $50/hour = $800 value → Can charge $50-100/month
✅ **Validated:** Yes, pursue!
