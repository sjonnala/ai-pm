## Connection to Interview Practice

**If asked: "How do you discover opportunities?"**

Your answer using this OST:
"I use Opportunity Solution Trees to systematically connect business outcomes to user needs. For example, [describe your outcome], I identified [#] key opportunities through [user research/data analysis]. I prioritized [Opportunity X] because [evidence/impact], then explored [#] solution approaches and designed experiments to test the riskiest assumptions first."
