## Interview Application

**When asked: "Walk me through how you build a product roadmap"**

**Your Answer:**

"I use a theme-based roadmap approach connected to strategy. For example, in my AI product roadmap:

**Themes:** I identified three strategic themes - Automation, Augmentation, and Agentic features - each tied to specific user outcomes.

**Prioritization:** I used RICE scoring to prioritize initiatives within themes, balancing quick wins (Month 1-3) with strategic bets (Month 4-6).

**Metrics:** Each initiative has clear success metrics tied back to our North Star metric.

**Communication:** I structure it as Now-Next-Later for clarity, and update stakeholders monthly.

The result was [X] initiatives over 6 months, with [specific outcome]."
