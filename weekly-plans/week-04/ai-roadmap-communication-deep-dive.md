# AI Roadmap Communication Deep Dive

**Week 4 Reference**

Translate complex AI roadmaps into crisp narratives that executives, engineers, and GTM teams adopt.

---

## 🧱 Roadmap Narrative Stack

| Layer | Purpose | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Vision Story** | Inspire stakeholders with end-state | "Customers get an AI co-pilot that anticipates work" |
| **Strategic Pillars** | Anchor themes (Automation, Augmentation, Agentic) | 3-4 pillars max |
| **Sequenced Bets** | Map crawl → walk → run | Show capability maturity |
| **Metrics & Proof** | Link to business impact | "Automation pillar unlocks +8pts retention" |

Build slides/one-pagers for each layer; reuse in exec reviews.

## 🗺️ Communication Surfaces

| Audience | Artifact | Cadence | Keys to Emphasize |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Exec Staff | 1-page memo + heatmap roadmap | Quarterly | Outcomes, investment, risk |
| Eng/Design | Notion doc + Jira/Epic links | Bi-weekly | Dependencies, readiness |
| GTM | Theme posters + enablement kit | Monthly | Messaging, launch dates |
| Customers/EAP | Vision sprint deck | As needed | Value, feedback loop |

## ⚖️ Prioritization Storytelling

Use the **"Bet Rationale Table"** so tough trade-offs are clear.

| Initiative | Pillar | Strategic Rationale | Cost | Risk Mitigation |
|------------|--------|---------------------|------|-----------------|
| Smart Automation | Automation | Reclaims 20% agent time; highest ARR impact | 2 teams | Human review workflow |
| AI Insights | Augmentation | Executive ask; supports enterprise upsell | 1 team | Staged rollout |

## 🧩 Dependency + Risk Map

Create a swimlane view:

```
Data Infra ──┬─ Build embeddings (May)
Platform  ───┼─ Launch API (Jun)
AI Team   ───┼─ Ship Gen2 model (Jul)
Product   ───┴─ Release AI Insights (Aug)
```

Call out blockers, owners, and mitigation steps so leadership can help unblock.
