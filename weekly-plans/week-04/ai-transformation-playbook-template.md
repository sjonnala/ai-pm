## Interview Application

**When asked: "How would you add AI to [existing product]?"**

**Your Answer (using this playbook):**

"I'd use a Crawl-Walk-Run transformation approach:

**Crawl (0-6 months):** Augment existing features. For example, [specific feature] could be enhanced with [AI capability]. This builds user trust and validates AI direction with low risk.

**Walk (6-12 months):** Build AI-native features. For example, [new capability enabled by AI]. This creates differentiation and drives engagement.

**Run (12-24 months):** Reimagine for AI-first. For example, [radical new experience]. This establishes leadership.

I'd prioritize based on impact-feasibility, measure success with [specific metrics], and mitigate risks through [specific approaches].

The result would be [transformation outcome]."
