## 🎯 What is Product Strategy

### **Definition**

**Product Strategy** is the plan for how your product will achieve its vision and win in the market.

**Strategy Answers:**
- **What** are we building? (and NOT building)
- **Who** are we building for? (and NOT for)
- **Why** will we win? (competitive advantage)
- **How** will we achieve our vision? (approach)

---

### **Why Strategy Matters**

**Without Strategy:**
- ❌ Roadmap becomes feature list
- ❌ Team lacks direction
- ❌ No competitive differentiation
- ❌ Reactive to market
- ❌ Resource waste

**With Strategy:**
- ✅ Clear direction
- ✅ Aligned team
- ✅ Competitive moat
- ✅ Proactive choices
- ✅ Efficient execution

---

### **Good Strategy vs. Bad Strategy**

**Bad Strategy:**
- Vague mission statements
- List of goals without how
- Copying competitors
- "We'll be the best at everything"
- Lots of buzzwords, no substance

**Good Strategy:**
- Specific choices
- Clear trade-offs
- Unique positioning
- Defensible advantage
- Concrete approach

**Example - Bad Strategy:**
"We will leverage AI to revolutionize productivity and become the leading platform for knowledge workers globally."

**Example - Good Strategy:**
"We will build the first AI writing assistant specifically for B2B SaaS marketers, focusing on SEO blog posts. We'll differentiate by integrating with marketing analytics tools and optimizing for conversion, not just content quality. We'll win by building the best data flywheel: better content → better SEO data → better AI."

---

## 🏗️ Vision, Strategy, Roadmap, Features Hierarchy

### **The Product Hierarchy**

```
Vision
  ↓
Strategy
  ↓
Roadmap
  ↓
Features
```

**Vision** = Where we're going (aspirational)
**Strategy** = How we'll get there (plan)
**Roadmap** = What we'll build when (execution)
**Features** = Specific capabilities (tactical)

---

### **Vision**

**What it is:** The aspirational future state

**Characteristics:**
- Inspirational
- Long-term (5-10 years)
- Unchanging (mostly)
- Simple to understand

**Examples:**

**GitHub:** "Every developer has a copilot"

**Notion:** "Make software toolmaking ubiquitous"

**ChatGPT:** "Build safe AGI that benefits humanity"

**Your AI Product:** "Enable every writer to publish 10x more high-quality content"

---

### **Strategy**

**What it is:** The plan to achieve the vision

**Characteristics:**
- Specific choices
- Medium-term (1-3 years)
- Adaptable based on learning
- Differentiating

**Components:**
- Target market
- Value proposition
- Competitive advantage
- Key capabilities
- Not doing (trade-offs)

**Example - GitHub Copilot Strategy:**

**Target:** Professional developers (not beginners)
**Value Prop:** 10x faster coding via AI autocomplete

---

### **Connecting the Layers**

**Bad Product Management:**
Vision → Features (skip strategy & roadmap)

**Good Product Management:**
Vision → Strategy → Roadmap → Features

**Every feature should answer:**
- ✅ How does this connect to strategy?
- ✅ Why this feature and not others?
- ✅ How does this differentiate us?

```

---

### **Framework 2: DHM Model (Gibson Biddle)**

**Developed by Gibson Biddle (Netflix VP Product)**

**DHM = Delight customers in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways**

**Three Questions:**

**1. How will we DELIGHT customers?**
- What creates joy/value?
- What makes product beloved?

**2. In ways that are HARD TO COPY?**
- What's our defensible advantage?
- What can't competitors replicate easily?

**3. In MARGIN-ENHANCING ways?**
- How does this make business better?
- Revenue increase or cost decrease?

---

#### **DHM Examples**

**Netflix (Gibson's example):**
- **Delight:** Personalized recommendations, binge-worthy content
- **Hard to Copy:** Recommendation algorithm (years of viewing data), Original content
- **Margin-Enhancing:** Better recommendations → higher retention → lower churn cost

**GitHub Copilot:**
- **Delight:** Write code 10x faster, feels like magic
- **Hard to Copy:** Exclusive access to GitHub's code dataset, IDE integration depth
- **Margin-Enhancing:** High willingness to pay ($10-20/month), low incremental cost

**Your AI Writing Tool:**
- **Delight:** [How will you delight users?]
- **Hard to Copy:** [What's unique to you?]
- **Margin-Enhancing:** [How does this improve business?]

---

### **Framework 3: Blue Ocean Strategy**

**Create uncontested market space instead of competing in red oceans.**

**Red Ocean (Competitive Market):**
- Fight for existing demand
- Beat the competition
- Exploit existing demand
- Make value-cost tradeoff

**Blue Ocean (New Market Space):**
- Create new demand
- Make competition irrelevant
- Create and capture new demand
- Break value-cost tradeoff

---

#### **Four Actions Framework**

**To create Blue Ocean, ask:**

**1. ELIMINATE:**
What factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?

**2. REDUCE:**
What factors should be reduced well below industry standard?

**3. RAISE:**
What factors should be raised well above industry standard?

**4. CREATE:**
What factors should be created that the industry has never offered?

---

#### **Blue Ocean Example: ChatGPT**

**ELIMINATE:**
- ❌ Complex setup/configuration
- ❌ Domain-specific training required
- ❌ Technical expertise needed

**REDUCE:**
- ⬇️ Cost (free tier vs. expensive enterprise AI)
- ⬇️ Learning curve
- ⬇️ Time to value

**RAISE:**
- ⬆️ Natural language interface quality
- ⬆️ Versatility (one tool for many tasks)
- ⬆️ Accessibility

**CREATE:**
- ✨ Conversational AI for everyone
- ✨ General-purpose AI assistant
- ✨ Viral sharing of conversations

**Result:** Created new market of "AI assistants for consumers," not competing with enterprise AI tools.

---

### **Framework 4: Jobs to be Done (JTBD)**

**Products are "hired" to do jobs. Strategy should focus on the job, not the product.**

**Job Statement Format:**
"When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome]."

**Example - GitHub Copilot:**
"When I'm writing boilerplate code, I want to autocomplete entire functions, so I can focus on creative problem-solving instead of syntax."

**Strategy Implication:**
- Compete with all solutions to that job (not just similar products)
- Understand context (situation) deeply
- Optimize for outcome, not features

---

#### **JTBD Strategy Canvas**

**For your AI product:**

**Main Job:**
When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [outcome].

**Related Jobs:**
1. [Related job 1]
2. [Related job 2]
3. [Related job 3]

**Current Solutions:**
- Solution A: [Pros/Cons]
- Solution B: [Pros/Cons]
- Our AI: [How we'll do it better]

**Underserved Needs:**
- [Need 1: Current solutions fail at this]
- [Need 2: Unmet need]

---

## ⚔️ Competitive Strategy

### **Porter's Five Forces**

**Classic framework for understanding competitive dynamics**

**1. Threat of New Entrants**
- How easy for new competitors to enter?
- Barriers to entry?

**AI Market Example:**
- **Low barriers:** LLMs are commoditized, APIs available
- **High barriers:** Proprietary data, distribution, brand

**Strategy:** Build barriers (data moats, network effects, brand)

---

**2. Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
- How much power do suppliers have?
- Can they raise prices?

**AI Market Example:**
- **OpenAI, Google, Anthropic** have high power (few LLM providers)
- Risk: They could raise API prices or compete with you

**Strategy:** Multi-model support, consider open-source, build switching costs

---

**3. Bargaining Power of Buyers**
- How much power do customers have?
- Can they negotiate?

**AI Market Example:**
- **Consumer:** Low power (small individual buyers)
- **Enterprise:** High power (big contracts, can negotiate)

**Strategy:** Focus on consumers or SMBs for pricing power

---

**4. Threat of Substitutes**
- What alternatives exist?
- How easily can users switch?

**AI Market Example:**
- ChatGPT can substitute for many AI tools
- Human labor can substitute for AI

**Strategy:** Differentiate deeply, make switching costly, provide unique value

---

**5. Rivalry Among Existing Competitors**
- How intense is competition?
- Price wars? Feature races?

**AI Market Example:**
- **Intense:** Everyone adding AI features
- **Race:** To best model, fastest inference, lowest cost

**Strategy:** Find niche, build moats, focus on specific use case

---

## 🎯 Interview Preparation

### **Strategy Interview Questions**

**Q: "Walk me through how you develop product strategy."**

**Great Answer:**

"I use a structured approach:

**1. Market Understanding:** Deep dive into users, competitive landscape, trends. What's changing? Where are opportunities?

**2. Define Winning:** What does success look like? Vision → Strategy → Roadmap hierarchy.

**3. Make Choices:** Use frameworks like Playing to Win (Where to play? How to win?) or DHM (Delight in Hard-to-copy, Margin-enhancing ways).

**4. Identify Moats:** What's our defensible advantage? Why can't competitors copy us?

**5. Validate:** Test strategy with customers, data, small experiments.

For example, [share specific strategy you developed and its impact]."

---

**Q: "How do you differentiate your product in a crowded market?"**

**Great Answer:**

"Differentiation starts with strategy, not features. I'd ask:

**1. Where can we win?** Not 'can we compete' but 'where do we have unique advantage?'

**2. Build moats:** What's hard to copy? Proprietary data? Network effects? Integration depth?

**3. Niche down:** Sometimes the best differentiation is specificity. 'AI writing tool for B2B SaaS marketers' beats 'AI writing tool.'

**4. Validate with users:** Does our differentiation matter to them?

For example, GitHub Copilot differentiated by exclusive GitHub data, deep IDE integration, and developer trust - hard for competitors to replicate."
