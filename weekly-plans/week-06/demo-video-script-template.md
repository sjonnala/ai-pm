```

**Visual Options:**
- Screenshot of current process
- Simple slide with problem statement
- Stats or quotes from user research

**Example:**
```
"Content creators struggle to come up with engaging blog outlines. Currently,
they spend 30+ minutes brainstorming and researching structure, and often end
up with generic outlines that don't stand out.

For example, a creator wanting to write about 'AI in healthcare' would need to
research similar articles, identify unique angles, and structure sections
manually."
```

---

### Solution Introduction (15-20 seconds)

**Visual:** Your prototype interface (first view)

**Script:**
```
"That's why I built [Product Name]. It's an AI-powered [category] that
[core capability].

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Visual:** Clean view of your interface, highlighting key elements

**Example:**
```
"That's why I built OutlineAI. It's an AI-powered blog outline generator that
creates detailed, unique outlines in seconds based on your topic.

Let me show you how it works."
```

---

### Core Demo - Happy Path (45-60 seconds)

**Visual:** Live walkthrough of your prototype

**Script:**
```
"Starting with the interface, users simply [first action].

[Demonstrate typing/clicking]

Here, I'm [specific action with specific example].

[Show AI processing]

The AI analyzes the request and generates [output type].

[Show output]

As you can see, it created [describe output]. Notice how it [highlight key
feature 1], [highlight key feature 2], and [highlight key feature 3].

Users can then [describe next action - refine/regenerate/accept]."
```

**Demo Flow:**
1. Start with clean interface
2. Enter a real, relatable example
3. Let them see the AI work (brief loading)
4. Show high-quality output
5. Highlight 2-3 key features
6. Show one interaction (regenerate or refine)

**Example:**
```
"Starting with the interface, users simply enter their blog topic.

Here, I'm typing 'How AI is transforming personalized medicine.'

The AI analyzes the request and generates a detailed outline.

As you can see, it created 6 main sections with bullet points for each. Notice
how it included current examples like CRISPR gene editing, suggested expert
quotes to include, and structured it for readability with actionable headers.

If users want to refine it, they can click 'Make it more technical' or
'Add more examples,' and the AI will regenerate."
```

**Pro Tips:**
- Type naturally (not too fast)
- Pause briefly to let viewers read output
- Use your cursor to highlight key parts
- Keep example realistic and relatable

---

### Edge Case or Iteration (15-20 seconds) - Optional but Impressive

**Visual:** Show how you handle a challenge

**Script:**
```
"One thing I learned during testing was [challenge]. So I added [feature/solution].

For example, if a user enters something vague like [vague input]...

[Demonstrate]

...the AI asks clarifying questions before generating, which improved
user satisfaction by [%]."
```

**Example:**
```
"One thing I learned during testing was that users often start with vague
topics. So I added clarification prompts.

For example, if a user just enters 'AI healthcare'...

...the AI responds with: 'I can help! To create the best outline, what's your
target audience? Doctors, patients, or general readers? And any specific area
of healthcare?'

This increased first-time success rate by 40%."
```

---

### Key Learnings (20-30 seconds)

**Visual:** Slide with key points OR continue on prototype showing features

**Script:**
```
"Through building this, I learned three key things:

First, [learning 1 - about prompt engineering].

Second, [learning 2 - about AI UX].

And third, [learning 3 - about user needs/metrics].

I tested this with [X] users and saw [key metric], which validated that
[insight]."
```

**Example:**
```
"Through building this, I learned three key things:

First, temperature settings matter more than I expected. Lowering it to 0.6
made outputs way more consistent.

Second, users want to see examples before they start. Adding sample prompts
increased usage by 3x.

And third, 'regenerate' was the most-used button, so I made it prominent and
added variations like 'make it longer' and 'make it simpler.'

I tested this with 12 content creators and saw an 8.5/10 satisfaction score,
which validated that AI can meaningfully speed up outline creation."
```

---

### Technical Approach (15-20 seconds) - Optional

**Visual:** Slide or on-screen text

**Script:**
```
"Technically, I used [model/platform] with custom prompts optimized for
[goal]. I iterated through [X] prompt versions, testing for [metrics].

The final architecture uses [brief technical summary]."
```

**Example:**
```
"Technically, I used GPT-4 with custom system prompts optimized for outline
structure and creativity. I iterated through 5 prompt versions, testing for
uniqueness, comprehensiveness, and formatting.

The final version uses chain-of-thought prompting to first analyze the topic,
then generate sections, then add details - which improved quality by 25%
compared to a single-shot prompt."
```

---

### Next Steps / Closing (15-20 seconds)

**Visual:** Your face or final slide

**Script:**
```
"Next, I'd [1-2 concrete next steps based on learnings].

This prototype demonstrates how I approach AI product development: rapid
iteration, user testing, and data-driven decisions.

Thanks for watching! [Call to action]."
```

**Example:**
```
"Next, I'd add conversation memory so users can refine outlines across multiple
turns, and A/B test different models to optimize for cost versus quality.

This prototype demonstrates how I approach AI product development: rapid
iteration, user testing, and data-driven decisions.

Thanks for watching! You can try the prototype yourself at [link], and I'd love
to hear your feedback."
```

## Example Scripts

### Example 1: AI Writing Tool (2 min)

```
[0:00-0:15] Hi, I'm Sarah. I built OutlineAI, an AI tool that helps content
creators generate detailed blog outlines in seconds. In this demo, I'll show
you how it works and what I learned.

[0:15-0:35] Content creators struggle to create engaging outlines. Currently,
they spend 30+ minutes researching and structuring, often ending up with
generic results. For example, writing about 'AI in healthcare' requires
researching similar articles, finding unique angles, and structuring manually.

[0:35-0:50] That's why I built OutlineAI. It generates detailed, unique outlines
based on your topic, complete with suggested examples and expert quote placeholders.

[0:50-1:35] Here's how it works. Users enter their topic - I'll use 'AI
transforming personalized medicine.' The AI generates a 6-section outline with
bullet points for each. Notice how it includes current examples, suggests expert
sources, and uses actionable headers. Users can refine by clicking 'Make it
more technical' or 'Add more examples.'

[1:35-1:50] One key learning: users often start vague. So I added clarification
prompts. If someone enters just 'AI healthcare,' the AI asks: 'What's your
target audience? Any specific area?' This increased success by 40%.

[1:50-2:05] I tested with 12 creators and saw 8.5/10 satisfaction. Technically,
I used GPT-4 with optimized prompts - 5 iterations, testing uniqueness and
formatting. Final version uses chain-of-thought prompting for 25% better quality.

[2:05-2:20] Next, I'd add conversation memory for multi-turn refinement and
A/B test models for cost optimization. Try it at outlineai.demo, and connect
with me on LinkedIn. Thanks!
```

---

### Example 2: AI Customer Support Tool (2.5 min)

```
[0:00-0:20] Hi, I'm Alex Chen. I built SupportAI, an AI assistant that helps
customer support teams draft personalized responses 10x faster. This demo shows
how it works and what I learned building it.

[0:20-0:45] Support agents spend 5-10 minutes per response, looking up policies,
personalizing tone, and ensuring accuracy. For example, a refund request requires
checking policy, order details, and writing empathetically. At scale, this
creates massive backlog and burnout.

[0:45-1:05] SupportAI solves this. Agents paste the customer message, select
the issue type, and get a personalized draft in seconds. They can edit before
sending, maintaining human oversight while saving time.

[1:05-2:00] Let me show you. Here's a frustrated customer requesting a refund.
The agent selects 'Refund Request' and clicks Generate. The AI analyzes the
message tone, pulls relevant policy info, and creates an empathetic response
that acknowledges frustration, explains the process, and offers next steps.
Notice how it matched the customer's tone, referenced their specific order,
and stayed within policy. The agent can now edit or send directly.

[2:00-2:20] Key learning: trust was the biggest challenge. I added a 'Show
Reasoning' feature that explains why the AI chose each element. This increased
agent adoption by 60% - they trusted it more when they understood it.

[2:20-2:35] I tested with 8 support agents at a local startup. Average response
time dropped from 6 minutes to 1 minute, and satisfaction scores improved
because responses were more consistent and empathetic.

[2:35-2:50] Technically, I used Claude 3 for empathy and GPT-4 for policy
accuracy, with a hybrid approach choosing the best model per scenario. I
iterated through 7 prompt versions, optimizing for tone matching and policy
compliance.

[2:50-3:05] Next, I'd integrate with helpdesk APIs to auto-pull order data,
and add learning from agent edits to improve over time. This demonstrates my
approach: user-centric, iterative, and data-driven. Thanks for watching!
```
