[Describe what your AI product does and how it solves the problem.]

Example: "AutoDoc is an AI-powered documentation assistant that automatically generates, updates, and maintains code documentation. It uses RAG to understand your codebase and generates documentation in your team's style, keeping it synchronized with every code change."

**Your Solution:**

[Your turn]

---

## Target User

**Who is this for?**

**Primary User:** [Specific user persona]

Example: "Mid-level to senior software engineers at tech companies (50-500 employees) working on complex codebases"

**Your Target User:**

[Your turn]

**Why this user?**

- [ ] **Feature 2:** [Name and brief description]
  - Why essential: [1 sentence]

- [ ] **Feature 3:** [Name and brief description]
  - Why essential: [1 sentence]

- [ ] **Feature 4:** [Name and brief description]
  - Why essential: [1 sentence]

- [ ] **Feature 5:** [Name and brief description]
  - Why essential: [1 sentence]

### Explicitly Out of Scope:
