## Part 3: Script Writing

### 3.1 Opening (First 30 Seconds) ⭐ CRITICAL

**Hook them immediately. First impressions matter!**

**Structure:**

```
Hi, I'm [Your Name]. [One sentence about your background].

I built [Product Name], an AI product that [solves X problem] for [target users].

In this video, I'll show you:
- The problem I'm solving
- How my AI solution works
- A live demo
- The technical approach
- What I learned as a PM

Let's dive in.
```

**Your Opening (Write it out word-for-word):**

[Your opening script here]

---

### 3.2 Problem Section Script

**Goal: Make the problem visceral and relatable**

**Template:**

```
[User persona] spends [X hours] per [timeframe] doing [tedious task].

Current solutions like [alternative 1] and [alternative 2] fall short because [specific weakness].

This isn't just annoying—it costs [time/money/opportunity]. With [market size] potential users, there's a huge opportunity to solve this with AI.

The question is: how can we use AI to [vision]?
```

**Your Problem Script:**

[Your script here]

### 3.3 Solution Overview Script

**Goal: Explain your product simply and clearly**

**Template:**

```
That's why I built [Product Name].

[Product Name] is an AI-powered [category] that [core value prop].

Here's how it works at a high level: [1-2 sentence explanation of mechanism].

The key innovation is [what makes it AI-native/unique]. Unlike [traditional approach], this AI approach [benefits].

Now let me show you how it works.
```

**Your Solution Script:**

[Your script here]

---

### 3.4 Demo Section Script

**For each demo scenario, script:**

**Before Demo:**
- [Setup context: "Imagine you're a software engineer who just pushed a new feature..."]

**During Demo:**
- [Narrate actions: "First, I'll connect the GitHub repository..."]
- [Highlight what's happening: "Notice how the AI is analyzing all the code files..."]
- [Point out key details: "In just 15 seconds, we have a complete technical overview..."]

**After Demo:**
- [Emphasize value: "What used to take 30 minutes now takes 15 seconds."]

**Demo 1 Script:**

### 3.5 Technical Approach Script

**Goal: Show you understand the "how" behind the "what"**

**Template:**

```
Let me quickly show you how this is built.

[Show architecture diagram]

The system consists of [3-5 key components]:
1. [Component 1: e.g., User interface built with X]
2. [Component 2: e.g., RAG pipeline using Y]
3. [Component 3: e.g., LLM (GPT-4) for generation]
4. [Component 4: e.g., Vector DB for semantic search]

I chose [key technology] because [rationale].

The main trade-offs I considered were [trade-off 1] vs [trade-off 2]. I went with [choice] because [reasoning based on use case].

One interesting challenge was [technical challenge]. I solved it by [solution].
```

**Your Technical Script:**

[Your script here]

### 3.6 Impact & Learnings Script

**Goal: Show business acumen and self-awareness**

**Template:**

```
So, what's the impact?

In beta testing with [X users], we saw:
- [Metric 1: e.g., "90% task success rate"]
- [Metric 2: e.g., "Average time savings of 5 hours/week"]
- [Metric 3: e.g., "NPS of 45"]

[Quote from beta user if available]

Building this taught me several things as an AI PM:

1. [Learning 1: e.g., "AI products require much more emphasis on evaluation and quality than traditional software"]
2. [Learning 2: e.g., "Getting to an 'aha moment' quickly is critical for AI products"]
3. [Learning 3: e.g., "Users need transparency about what AI can and can't do"]

If I were to build this again, I'd [what you'd do differently and why].

## Part 5: Recording Best Practices

### 5.1 Recording Strategy

**Option 1: One-Take Wonder**
- Record the entire video start to finish
- **Pros:** Feels more natural, flows better
- **Cons:** Mistakes require full re-record

**Option 2: Section by Section**
- Record each section separately
- **Pros:** Easier to fix mistakes, can take breaks
- **Cons:** More editing, might feel disjointed

**Option 3: Hybrid**
- Record in 2-3 chunks (intro/demo/conclusion)
- **Pros:** Balance of flow and flexibility
- **Cons:** Some editing required

**Recommended:** Start with Option 2 for your first video. Once comfortable, try Option 1.

---

### 5.2 Speaking Tips

**Voice:**
- Speak slightly slower than normal conversation
- Vary your tone (don't be monotone)
- Project energy and enthusiasm (you're excited about this!)
- Smile when you talk (it changes your voice tone)
- Avoid filler words (um, uh, like, you know)

**Pacing:**
- Pause between sections (easier to edit)
- Don't rush through demos (viewers need time to absorb)
- Slow down for key points

**Delivery:**
- Sound confident (even if you're nervous)
- Be conversational (not reading a boring script)
- Imagine talking to a smart friend, not giving a presentation

---

### 5.3 Demo Recording Tips

**Before Each Demo:**
- State what you're about to show: "Let me show you how this works for a software engineer..."
- Ensure demo is ready (right screen, right state)

**During Demo:**
- **Move cursor intentionally:** Don't wave it around randomly
- **Highlight key UI elements:** Circle or point to important parts
- **Narrate your actions:** "I'm clicking on 'Generate Documentation'..."
- **Pause after actions:** Give viewers time to see results
- **Call out what's happening:** "Notice how the AI is analyzing the code structure..."

**If Something Goes Wrong:**
- Don't panic
- Pause recording (if recording sections)
- Fix the issue
- Resume or re-record that section
- **OR** keep going and edit it out later

**Pro Tip:** Record demos separately so you can re-do them without re-recording narration

---

### 5.4 Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Impact | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **Too long** | Viewers drop off | Stick to 8-10 min max, edit ruthlessly |
| **Poor audio** | Unwatchable | Invest in decent mic, quiet room |
| **Too fast** | Viewers confused | Slow down, especially during demos |
| **Too much jargon** | Alienates non-technical viewers | Explain terms, assume less knowledge |
| **No structure** | Viewers get lost | Follow clear structure (problem → solution → demo) |
| **Boring delivery** | Viewers tune out | Show enthusiasm, energy |
| **Doesn't work** | Embarrassing | Test everything beforehand |
| **No call-to-action** | No follow-up | Tell viewers where to learn more |

---

## Appendix A: Sample Scripts

### Sample Opening (30 seconds)

```
Hi, I'm Alex Chen, and I'm transitioning into AI product management.

Over the past 12 weeks, I built DocuAI—an AI-powered documentation assistant that automatically generates and maintains technical documentation for software teams.

In this 9-minute demo, I'll show you the problem I'm solving, how the AI solution works, a live demo, the technical approach, and what I learned as an AI PM.

Let's dive in.
```

---

### Sample Problem Section (1.5 minutes)

```
Software engineers spend an average of 3-5 hours per week writing and maintaining documentation. That's 15-25% of their time—time that could be spent building features or fixing bugs.

Current solutions fall into two buckets:

First, manual documentation tools like Confluence or Notion. They're flexible, but they require engineers to manually write everything, keep it updated, and format it correctly. The result? Documentation becomes outdated almost immediately.

Second, auto-generated docs like Javadoc or Doxygen. These extract comments from code, but they're purely descriptive—they don't explain the "why," the architecture, or how components fit together.

This isn't just frustrating for engineers. It costs businesses real money. Poor documentation leads to:
- Slower onboarding (new engineers take 2-3 months to get up to speed)
- More bugs (developers don't understand existing systems)
- Lost productivity (engineers waste time searching for information)

With over 20 million software engineers globally, and documentation being a universal pain point, there's a massive opportunity to use AI to solve this problem.

The question is: can AI understand code well enough to generate truly helpful documentation—not just descriptions, but explanations of how and why things work?

That's what I set out to build.
