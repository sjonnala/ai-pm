| **COGS (Cost of Goods Sold)** | [e.g., $5/user/mo] | [AI costs, infrastructure, support] |
| **Gross Margin** | [e.g., 75%] | [(ARPU - COGS) / ARPU] |
| **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)** | [e.g., $100] | [Sales + marketing cost per customer] |
| **Payback Period** | [e.g., 5 months] | [CAC / (ARPU - COGS)] |
| **LTV (Lifetime Value)** | [e.g., $1,200] | [ARPU × Avg customer lifetime in months] |
| **LTV:CAC Ratio** | [e.g., 12:1] | [LTV / CAC — target >3:1] |

---

**AI Cost Modeling:**

[Critical for AI products—what are your inference costs?]

| Cost Component | Per Request | Monthly (@ scale) | Notes |
|----------------|-------------|-------------------|-------|
| **LLM API Calls** | [e.g., $0.002] | [e.g., $2,000 @ 1M calls] | [Which model? GPT-4, Claude?] |
| **Vector DB** | [e.g., $0.0001] | [e.g., $100] | [Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.] |
| **Compute** | [e.g., $0.0005] | [e.g., $500] | [AWS/GCP infrastructure] |
| **Total Cost** | [e.g., $0.0026] | [e.g., $2,600] | [Per request cost] |

**Pricing Implication:**

[Given costs of $0.0026 per request, if average user makes 100 requests/month, COGS = $0.26/user. At $20/mo ARPU, gross margin = 98.7%. Make sure your pricing makes sense given your costs.]

---

### 5.4 Path to Profitability

**Year 1 Financial Projections (High-Level):**

| Quarter | Users | ARPU | Revenue | Costs | Profit/Loss |
|---------|-------|------|---------|-------|-------------|

## Part 9: Risks & Mitigations

### 9.1 Risk Assessment

**Identify Top Risks:**

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency |
|------|------------|--------|------------|-------------|
| **Technical: AI quality issues** | [Medium] | [High] | [Rigorous eval framework, beta testing] | [Human-in-the-loop fallback] |
| **Market: Competition** | [High] | [Medium] | [Move fast, differentiate, build moat] | [Pivot positioning if needed] |
| **Business: Can't acquire users cheaply** | [Medium] | [High] | [Test channels early, focus on organic] | [Extend runway, refine targeting] |
| **Regulatory: AI regulation** | [Low] | [Medium] | [Stay compliant, monitor landscape] | [Adapt product as needed] |
| **Product: Poor retention** | [Medium] | [High] | [Focus on aha moment, measure early] | [Rapid iteration on onboarding] |
| [Your risk] | [Likelihood] | [Impact] | [Mitigation] | [Contingency] |

### 9.2 Mitigation Plans

**For Each High-Impact Risk, Detail Mitigation:**

**Risk: [e.g., "AI quality issues lead to poor user experience"]**

- **Mitigation Strategy:**
  - [Action 1: e.g., "Implement evaluation framework from Day 1"]
  - [Action 2: e.g., "Beta test with 50 users before public launch"]
  - [Action 3: e.g., "Set up monitoring and alerts"]

- **Early Warning Signs:**
  - [Sign 1: e.g., "NPS <20"]
  - [Sign 2: e.g., "Retention <30% after Day 7"]

- **Contingency Plan:**
  - [If quality issues persist: e.g., "Add human review layer, reduce AI scope"]
