## Part 2: North Star Metric

### 2.1 Defining Your North Star

**What is a North Star Metric?**

The single metric that best captures the core value you deliver to customers. It should:
- Reflect value delivered to customers
- Predict long-term success
- Be measurable
- Be actionable

---

**Your North Star Metric:**

| Element | Your Answer |
|---------|-------------|
| **Metric Name** | [e.g., "Weekly Documentation Pages Generated"] |
| **Definition** | [Exactly how is it calculated?] |
| **Why This Metric** | [Why does this best represent value?] |
| **Current Value** | [e.g., 1,500 pages/week] |
| **30-Day Target** | [e.g., 3,000 pages/week] |
| **90-Day Target** | [e.g., 10,000 pages/week] |
