```
Headline: What I Learned as an AI PM

Key Learnings:

1. AI Product ≠ Traditional Product
   → Evaluation is 2x as important
   → User expectations require careful management
   → Edge cases are the norm, not the exception

2. Get to "Aha Moment" Faster
   → First-time users need value in <2 minutes
   → Demos matter more for AI products

3. Quality > Features (for AI)
   → Users forgive missing features
   → Users don't forgive bad AI outputs

4. Prompt Engineering is a PM Skill
   → 80% of product quality comes from prompts
   → Testing and iteration are essential

5. Human-in-the-Loop is a Feature
   → Users want control, not full automation
   → AI suggestions > AI decisions

If I Were to Start Over:
• Test with real users sooner (week 1, not week 6)
• Build eval framework before building product
• Focus on one use case deeply (vs. many shallow)
```

- Large, readable fonts (minimum 20pt for body, 36pt+ for titles)
- High contrast (dark text on light background or vice versa)
- Whitespace is your friend (don't cram)

**Visual Hierarchy:**
- Most important info = largest
- Use bold, color, size to guide attention
- Align elements (left, center, right—but be consistent)

**Professional Polish:**

## Part 4: Presentation Best Practices

### 4.1 Delivery Tips

**Before You Present:**

- **Rehearse:** Practice 3-5 times until smooth
- **Time yourself:** Stay within your target (10-12 min)
- **Anticipate questions:** Prepare answers to likely questions
- **Know your slides:** Don't just read them
- **Test tech:** Ensure slides work on presentation device

**During Presentation:**

**Voice:**
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Project confidence (even if nervous)
- Vary your tone (don't be monotone)
- Pause for emphasis
- Avoid filler words (um, uh, like)

**Body Language:**
- Stand tall, shoulders back
- Make eye contact (if presenting live)
- Use hand gestures (but don't overdo it)
- Move intentionally (don't pace)
- Smile (shows enthusiasm)

**Slide Discipline:**
- Don't read slides word-for-word
- Expand on what's on screen
- Point to visuals (if presenting live)
- Advance slides at appropriate pace (not too fast, not too slow)

---

### 4.2 Storytelling Techniques

**Hook Them Early:**

Start with a relatable story or statistic:
- "Imagine spending 20% of your week on a task everyone hates..."
- "Last year, companies wasted $10 billion on..."
- "Every engineer I talked to said the same thing..."

**Use the Rule of Three:**

Group things in threes (easier to remember):
- "Three reasons this matters..."
- "I learned three key lessons..."
- "We focus on speed, quality, and ease of use."

**Show, Don't Tell:**

Instead of: "Our AI is fast"
Say: "From code to documentation in 15 seconds. Let me show you."

**Use Transitions:**

Connect slides with transition phrases:
- "Now that we understand the problem, let's look at the solution..."
- "You saw how it works. Now let's talk about why this approach..."
- "With that context, here's the impact..."

---

### 4.3 Handling Questions

**Types of Questions:**

**Clarification Questions:**
- **Question:** "How does the AI handle [specific edge case]?"
- **Response:** Answer directly, reference your eval framework if applicable

**Challenge Questions:**
- **Question:** "Why not just use [competitor]?"
- **Response:** Acknowledge the alternative, then explain your differentiation

**Hypothetical Questions:**
- **Question:** "What if [unlikely scenario]?"
- **Response:** "That's an interesting edge case. Here's how I'd think about it..."

**General Tips:**

- **Don't panic:** All questions are opportunities to showcase thinking
- **It's okay to say "I don't know":** Follow with "but here's how I'd figure it out"
- **Clarify if needed:** "Just to make sure I understand, you're asking about X?"
- **Keep answers concise:** 30-60 seconds max
- **Tie back to your work:** Reference slides, artifacts, decisions you made

---

### 4.4 Remote Presentation Tips

**If presenting over Zoom/video call:**

- **Test tech ahead of time:** Screen share, audio, video
- **Close unnecessary tabs/apps:** Only show your slides
- **Look at camera when speaking:** Not at screen (if you want eye contact)
- **Share screen, not just window:** So viewers can see full slides
- **Use presenter view:** See your notes, next slide
- **Mute notifications:** No Slack/email interruptions
- **Have backup:** PDF version ready in case tech fails

---

## Part 5: Speaker Notes

### 5.1 How to Use Speaker Notes

**What are speaker notes?**

Hidden notes below each slide that only you see (in presenter view). Use them for:
- Full sentences to say (if you want to script)
- Key points to remember
- Timing cues
- Transition phrases

**Example Speaker Notes for Slide 2 (Problem):**

```
[Slide 2: Problem]

Speaker Notes:

"Engineers spend an average of 3 to 5 hours per week on documentation. That's 20% of their time.

[PAUSE]

And here's the kicker: 70% of that documentation is outdated within just 3 months. So all that time spent writing docs? Wasted.

This isn't just frustrating for engineers. It costs businesses real money. Poor documentation leads to slower onboarding—new engineers take 2-3 months to get up to speed. It leads to more bugs, because developers don't understand existing systems. And it causes lost productivity as engineers waste time searching for information that should be readily available.

With over 20 million software engineers globally, and documentation being a universal pain point, there's a massive opportunity here.

[TRANSITION]: So that's the problem. Now let's talk about the opportunity..."
```

---

### 5.2 Sample Speaker Notes for Each Slide

**Slide 1: Title**

```
"Hi everyone. Thanks for taking the time to review my AI PM portfolio project.

Over the past 12 weeks, I built [Product Name], an AI product that [value prop].

Today I'll walk you through the problem I'm solving, the solution I built, and what I learned as an AI PM.

Let's get started."
```

---

**Slide 3: Opportunity**

```
"So we've established the problem. But how big is the opportunity?

[Walk through market size]

Why is now the right time? Three reasons:

First, generative AI makes this possible. Two years ago, we couldn't do this.

Second, remote work has increased the need for async communication. Good documentation is more critical than ever.

Third, developer productivity is a top priority for tech leaders. Tools that save engineering time have clear ROI.

Current solutions don't address this opportunity. Manual tools require too much work. Auto-generated docs lack context.

There's a gap in the market for an AI-native solution."
```

---

**Slide 5: Product Demo**

```
"Let me show you how it works.

[Walk through demo]

Notice three things:

First, speed. This takes 15 seconds, versus 30 minutes manually.

Second, quality. The AI understands code context, not just syntax.

Third, control. Users can review and edit the output. It's AI assistance, not AI automation.

This is what an AI-native product looks like."
```

---

**Slide 14: Learnings**

```
"Building this taught me a lot about AI product management.

The biggest learning? AI products are fundamentally different from traditional products.

Evaluation is twice as important. You can't just ship and iterate. You need robust quality measures from day one.

User expectations need careful management. If you promise AI magic and deliver mediocre results, you lose trust immediately.

And edge cases aren't edge cases—they're the norm. AI products fail in unexpected ways, so you need comprehensive testing.

[Continue through other learnings]

If I were to do this again, I'd test with real users much sooner. I waited until week 6. I should have started week 1.

I'd also build the evaluation framework before building the product. Quality should be designed in, not bolted on.

These are the kinds of insights you only get by building."
```

## Appendix A: Slide Design Examples

### Example: Problem Slide

```
────────────────────────────────────────
Engineers Waste 5+ Hours Per Week
on Documentation
────────────────────────────────────────

• 70% of documentation is outdated
  within 3 months

• Poor docs cost $10K+ per engineer
  annually in lost productivity

• Current tools require too much manual
  effort or produce low-quality output

AI Pipeline:
  • Code Parser → AST Analysis
  • Vector DB (Pinecone) → Semantic Search
  • LLM (GPT-4) → Doc Generation
       ↓
Output: Markdown Documentation

Key Decisions:
✓ GPT-4 for quality (vs. 3.5 for cost)
✓ RAG approach for code context
✓ Incremental updates for efficiency
